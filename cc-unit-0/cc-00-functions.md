### Objectives:
1. Know the difference between console.log and return. 
2. Know that console.log is how we “test”
3. Familiarize themselves with the terminology we use to explain our code


### Terminology
1. **Statement**: A single line of code in JavaScript. A computer reads JavaScript statement by statement.  When referencing a line of code I am referencing a statement. 
2. **Return**: A keyword within the scope of a function that will produce a value and terminate the function. 
3. **Console.log:** A method(a another function) that takes in an unlimited amount of arguments and prints them to the console. 
4. **Function**: statement or set of statements that will execute to produce a value. 
5. **Test**: How to check to see that we are produce the expected outcome. We test by console logging/printing statements to the console. 
6. **Invoke**: When we “call” a function to execute, we are invoking it. This happens when we write `()` after a function. 
7. **Comment**: How we can write notes in a function. We can comment any line of code or add comments in JavaScript using `//`

Lesson Notes:
- **After a function returns something, the function is done executing.** Code that comes after a return statement will not run.
- `console.logs` are used for testing and printing, but it is not the same as returning.
