### Objectives:
- What is an expression?
- What are comparison and logical operators?
- What are the 6 falsy values? How can they affect expressions using logical or comparison operators?


### Terminology
1. **Expression**: A unit of code that evaluates to a single value. 
2. **Operator**: Used to performing specific mathematical and logical computations on operands.
3. **Operands:** The values that an operator is performing computations on. 
4. **Falsy**: A [falsy (sometimes written falsey) value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.
5. **Truthy**: A [truthy value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) is a value that is considered true when encountered in a Boolean context.
